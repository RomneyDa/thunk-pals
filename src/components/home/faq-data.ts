        question: "Why wouldn't I hire a full-time data analyst?",
        answer: "Great question! For starters, the annual cost of a full-time Sr. Data Analyst is over $75,000, plus benefits (if you can find one with the skills you need). Besides that, you may not always have enough work to keep them busy at all times - so you're stuck paying for time you can't utilize. With our service, you can skip the recruitment, onboarding, and training stages, which saves even more money. Plus, you can pause and resume your plan, ensuring you only pay when you have work that needs to be done."
